# TBK Mini
PLEASE NOTE
This is a simple mirroring of the files as they were in the uploaded state of MINI_V2 v89.f3d. I did not use stl files, but 3mf files. They work with modern slicers just fine, and the Fusion file is there too.

A Dactyl Manuform Mini. Silent and compact, with per-key RGB.

# Sourcing the components

## Electronic components

You will need to order the parts from a shop, and order some PCBs directly from the manufacturer.

The Elite-C Adapters are open-source. At this moment, the flexible PCBs are not. Instead, you can use Amoebas.

Parts list:

| Part name                         | Amount | Link                                                                                    |

If you don't want to source the Elite-C adapter PCB, you can use the [printable shield adapter from Geoff](https://github.com/geoffder/dometyl-keyboard/blob/main/things/holders/bastardkb/printable_shield.stl).

If you want RGB, you will also need:

| Part name          | Amount | Link       |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------- |
| SK6812 Mini-E LEDs | 42     | Aliexpress |
